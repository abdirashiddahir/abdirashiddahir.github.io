<p align="justify">I am a PhD Candidate studying just transition to electric vehicles in the Department of Geography, The Ohio State University. I also hold a master's degree in Transportation Engineering from the University of Seoul, South Korea.</p>

<p align="justify">My research addresses the justice and equity implications of the energy transition from an interdisciplinary perspective. My dissertation project, titled “Just Transition to Electric Vehicles: Integrating Transportation, Energy, and Climate Justice” particularly addresses the National Academies-identified Grand Challenges and Opportunities for the Twenty-first Century, including (1) curbing climate change while also adapting to its impacts, and (2) developing efficient, healthy, and sustainable cities and communities. My goal is to apply my findings to practice, sustainability education, and community outreach initiatives.</p>
