<p align="justify">I am currently on the academic job market for the 2024-2025 cycle!</p>

<p align="justify">You can find my CV <a href="/files/Abdirashid.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">I am a PhD Candidate studying sustainable transition to electric vehicles in the Department of Geography, The Ohio State University. I also hold a master's degree in Transportation Engineering from the University of Seoul, South Korea.</p>

<p align="justify">My research addresses the sustainability implications of the energy transition from an interdisciplinary perspective. Sustainability science often trancends disciplinary boundaries. Given that electric vehicle transition is a complex process that involves not only transportation system but also energy infrastructure and climate change, I embrace an interdisciplinary approach to integrate multiple fields of study including transportation science, economic philosophy, econometrics, and complexity science in my dissertation project. I draw on semi-structured qualitative interviews, quantitative surveys, and agent-based modeling approaches to conceptualize, measure and model sustainable transition to electric vehicles in Columbus, Ohio (USA).</p>

My work contributes to understanding the social dimension of sustainability to promote adequate access to affordable energy for electric vehicles in a car-dependent society and the environmental dimension of sustainability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. My doctoral research particularly addresses the National Academies-identified Grand Challenges and Opportunities for the Twenty-first Century, including (1) curbing climate change while also adapting to its impacts, and (2) developing efficient, healthy, and sustainable cities and communities. My goal is to apply my findings to practice, sustainability education, and community outreach initiatives.</p>

<p align="justify">Climate change is deeply personal for me. Overwhelming majority of my family members are nomads who have been reliant on their livestock for their livelihoods for generations. However, climate change-induced recurrent droughts wiped out my grandfather's camels in the span of a decade. To fight climate change in the transportation sector, I am studying transportation electrification and the findings will have implications for academic and policy milieux beyond U.S. borders. </p>

<p align="justify">My research also makes contribution to sustainable transportation and urban development. My work in this area has spanned 6 years starting in South Korea and culminating in the United States. In South Korea, I studied how Asian cities are different from North American and European contexts in an era of knowledge-based innovation and services in post-industrial cities, and worked with researchers at the Marron Institute of Urban Management at New York University who are developing a database with over 500 projects from more than 40 countries. In the US context, I have researched the impacts of bicycle facilities on residential property values and the impacts of bicycle networks on bike traffic volume in more than 10 cities.  </p>
