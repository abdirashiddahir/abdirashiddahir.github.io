<p align="justify">Past studies on the relationship between the built environment and travel mode choice were conducted with cross-sectional design in the Western context and lack the consideration of industry agglomeration. This study draws upon longitudinal panel data covering 78 districts in the Seoul metropolitan area over four time periods (2002, 2006, 2010, and 2016) to examine the effect of the built environment and industrial agglomeration on travel mode choices using longitudinal multilevel linear regression models. Findings from the present study reveal that changes in travel mode choice can be attributed to changes in the built environment, such as density, urban design, and destination accessibility. Additionally, the heterogeneity of knowledge and manufacturing employment influences travel choices, with intensive clustering of finance, education, real estate, and hospitality jobs moderating car travel demand and facilitating a shift towards transit modes. This study provides evidence for the efforts to rein in car use and promote transit and active travel through pedestrian-oriented and transit-oriented developments in synergy with the metropolitan economic structure in an era of knowledge-based innovation and services in post-industrial cities.</p>
